# oldTVThingy
Installation and demo video coming soon
Made originally for my own personal use so exceptionally messy right now.


Simple to run TV Simulation with following features:
- Channels
- Episodes airing in order
- Show Seasons
- Ad-breaks
- Channel Idents
- Keyboard/Remote Control support
- Teletext (episode guide, weather, jokes and more to come)
- Easy and lightweight to run. No live streaming required.
- Very bad admin and upload panel

TODO:
- Season specific airings (christmas, halloween etc.)
- Airings with specific timeslots
- Queue generation optimizations
- More teletext options (time specific news, sms chat room......)
- User-friendly admin panel
- Custom designs/themes
